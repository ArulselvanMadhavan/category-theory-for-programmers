* Categories Great and Small
** No Objects
   - Category with zero objects
   - zero morphisms
   - Not very useful by itself.
   - Becomes useful in the context of other categories
** Simple Graphs
   - Build categories by connecting objects with arrows.
   - Graph to Category
     - Directed Graph
     - Add identity arrow at each node
     - Take two Composable arrows and add a new arrow to serve as
       their composition.
     - Add as many arrows as you can
   - /Free Category/
     - The process of completing a given structure by extending it
       with minimum number of items to satisfy its laws(laws of category)
** Orders
   - A category where a morphism is a relation between objects.
   - Hom-set
     - A set of morphisms going from object a to object b in a
       category C
     - C(a,b)
   - Pre Order
     - There is atmost one morphism going from any object /a/ to any
       object /b/.
     - "Thin" Category
     - C(a, a) - singleton (Identity arrow)
     - Cycles are allowed
   - Partial Order
     - Cycles are not allowed
   - Total Order
   - Sorting algorithms can only work on total orders.
   - Partial orders can be sorted using topological sort.
** Monoids as Set
   - Traditionally, monoid is defined as a set with a binary operation.
   - Binary operation
     - Needs to be associative
     - There is one special element that behaves like unit with
       respect to the binary operation.
   - Point-free
     - Function equality without specifying the arguments is described
       as point-free.
** Monoid as Category
   - A Monoid is a single object category with a set of morphisms that
     follow appropriate rules of composition.
   - We can always recover a set monoid from a category monoid. For
     all intents and purposes they are one and the same.
** Morphisms don't have to form a set
   - A category in which morphisms between any two objects form a set
     is called locally small.
